                    <p>For as long as I can remember, the creative arts have always piqued my interest,
                        with much of my childhood spent reading books and dabbling in arts and crafts.
                        Creative writing has always been at the forefront of my creative expression with
                        it recently manifesting itself in the form of songwriting. Introdcued to photography
                        at a young age, I found myself often reaching for a camera wherever the opportunity
                        presented itself, snapping photos of whatever drew my curiosity and attention at
                        the time. All of these culminated in my interest and pursuit of a career in the arts, 
                        specifically in design. The digital world captivated me and served as an outlet for
                        my desire of freedom. My creative style can be best described as "purposeful", "intricate"
                        and "modern", with much care placed into the small and large details of whatever work I am 
                        producing.
